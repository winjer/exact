What is EXACT?
==============

EXACT is a program that implements "POP Before SMTP Relay Authentication".  

It will work as is with these POP/IMAP servers:

  * UW-IMAPD_
  * Cyrus_
  * Courier_ (IMAPD and POPD)
  * Perdition_ 
  * Qpopper_ 
  * TeaPOP_
  * Cubic Circle's cucipop_
  
and these MTAs:

  * Exim_
  * Sendmail_
  * Postfix_

It doesn't support qmail_ as-is, because qmail is rather unique.  See below for
some other software that might help though.

All patches to improve compatibility, and regex stanzas for other POP/IMAP
servers gratefully received.

Why is it called EXACT?
=======================

EXACT stands for EXperimental Access Control Thing.  With apologies to Philip
Hazel.  As you may have guessed, marketing is not my strong suit.

What is "POP Before SMTP Relay Authentication"?
===============================================

POP Before SMTP Relay Authentication is commonly used on systems that provide
both IMAP or POP services and SMTP services.  If you have users who move from
system to system, and access their mail over IMAP or POP, it is a fair bet that
they will also want to send mail via your IMAP server.  

If your users are using Windows they probably don't have a locally installed
mail relay, so they have to use someone else's.  Also, some (broken) sites refuse
email from dialup systems on the grounds that the email might be spam.

Generally you should send mail through your network providers local SMTP
servers.  However, sometimes it's not obvious what those servers are (at least
to your users), and sometimes these servers provide poor service and so you wish
to avoid them.

Therefore, you would like to provide an SMTP relay for those users only.  SMTP
Authentication is an option, however not all clients provide it and, more
irritatingly, on PAM-based systems authenticating against the shadow file is
impossible for non root processes.  Well, I couldn't get it to work anyway.

So a simple hack is often used - to selectively allow SMTP relaying for IP
addresses that have recently authenticated against a local IMAP or POP server.

How does it work?
=================

When started, the program watches a log file for lines written by a POP or IMAP
server that indicate a successful login.  Generally this is a file written by
syslog, by default /var/log/mail.log.  On your system it may be different.

You have two options for the output format of EXACT:

Berkeley Database Format
------------------------

The venerable 'db' or 'dbm' format.  If the Berkeley Database libraries (libdb)
are available on your system, then run configure with --with-db.  Exact will
then output dbm files instead of a text format relay file.  This is compatible
with Exim and Postfix.

If you haven't got these libraries they are probably packaged by your distro.
To compile from source, download them from Sleepycat_.

To write in text format even though you configured with --with-db, see the
authtype parameter in exact.conf.

.. _Sleepycat: http://www.sleepycat.com/

Text Format
-----------

Alternatively you can write the database out in text format, with one ip address
per line.

Your MTA can then be configured to read this file, to determine hosts that are
allowed to relay.

Where can I get EXACT?
======================

The current production version of EXACT is 1.40.  This is available here:

    http://adju.st/dist/exact/exact-1.40.tar.gz

There is also a `mailing list`_ for announcements.  I suggest you join this for
bug fix and security information.

.. _`mailing list`: http://adju.st/mailman/listinfo/exact-announce

What other software does this?
==============================

DRAC_ performs the same task, using patched IMAP and POP servers.  I didn't
like this approach and haven't tried it, however YMMV.

popbsmtp_ uses the same technique as EXACT, and is written in Perl.

There are also some perl scripts_ from some other guy called Doug_
available, that work with exim pretty easily (although they do require tweaking)
- I've not tried them with any other MTA.

For qmail, smtp-poplock_ works well.

.. _Doug: http://cc.ysu.edu/~doug/
.. _smtp-poplock: http://www.davideous.com/smtp-poplock/
.. _popbsmtp: http://popbsmtp.sourceforge.net/

How do I make it work with my POP/IMAP Server?
==============================================

The exact-servers.conf file contains the necessary configuration for all
the servers I've tried, or that users have provided configurations for.

To select the server that you wish to use, just change the 'server' parameter
in the exact.conf file to match one of the stanzas in exact-servers.conf.  This
is done automatically by the configure script, when you use the --with-server
option.

If your POP/IMAP server isn't listed in exact-servers.conf, you can add your
own configuration easily if you have some experience of regular expressions.
The REs used are in Extended POSIX Regular Expression Syntax.

The order parameter can be either 'username,address' or 'address,username' and
this specifies the order of the parenthesised expressions for those terms that
will be extracted.  For historical reasons (supporting the weird UW-IMAP
logging output in fact), these are in fact the **SECOND** and **THIRD**
parenthesised expressions respectively.  The **FIRST** bracketed expression is
dropped on the floor.

See the examples in the exact-servers.conf file, hopefully it'll make sense.

How do I make it work with my MTA?
==================================

Exim 
----

This is very simple to implement in Exim.  

For text-format output, add a line like:

``host_accept_relay = 127.0.0.1:net-lsearch;/var/state/exact/relay``

For db-format output, add a line like:

``host_accept_relay = 127.0.0.1:net-dbm;/var/state/exact/relay``

where ``/var/state/exact/relay`` is the location of the relay file written by 
exact.

You should be aware that when using exim, exact should be started first - if 
exim cannot find the state file when it starts then it will exit.

Sendmail
--------

Here's a tip from Johan Vansant describing how to make EXACT work with
Sendmail:

In order to have sendmail check an extra file you need to expand the rules.
Here is what I added to the 'mc' file, this can be added to the 'cf' file
directly if you leave out the 'LOCAL_CONFIG' and 'LOCAL_RULESETS' lines::

    LOCAL_CONFIG
    #POP Auth
    F{POPAuth} /var/state/exact/relay
    
    SLocal_check_rcpt
    R<$+ @ $=w >            $@ OK # if it is to domain delivered by us
    R$+                     $: $(dequote "" $&{client_addr} $) $| $1 # get address
    R$={POPAuth}$* $| $*    $@ OK # OK if from a POP-authed address
    ROK                     $@ OK
    R$*                     $#error $@ 5.5.0 $: "550 Relaying denied: authenticate with POP first"

Thanks Johan :)

Postfix
-------

In main.cf have a line like:

mynetworks = 127.0.0.0/8, hash:/var/state/exact/relay

You must use db format output for postfix to work.  Postfix has some
requirements for the ownership of the relay file.  I have been told that you
should configure exact to write the relay file with group adm for it to work.
You can configure the group in exact.conf.

What's all the funny syntax in this file?
=========================================

If you are reading the text version of this file, you might have noticed some
odd syntax.  This file is written in reStructuredText.  This can be converted to
HTML (and other things) using docutils_.
